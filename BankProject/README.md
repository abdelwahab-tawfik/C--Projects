# Bank Management System (Console Application)

This project is a **console-based Bank Management System** implemented in **C++**.  
It was developed as part of **Algorithms & Problem Solving – Level 3** from the  
**ProgrammingAdvices.com roadmap** by **Dr. Mohammed Abu-Hadhoud**.

The project focuses on applying **algorithmic thinking, clean code principles, and file-based data management** to simulate a simple real-world banking system.

## 📘 Project Context

This project is one of the **practical projects** in:

**Algorithms & Problem Solving – Level 3**  
An advanced, practice-intensive course designed to build:
- Programming endurance
- Clean and structured problem solving
- Realistic system thinking using C++

The goal of this project is **not UI or frameworks**, but **logic, structure, and correctness** under real-world–like requirements.

- Add a new client
- Update existing client information
- Delete a client
- Find a client by account number

### Transactions
- Deposit money
- Withdraw money (with balance validation)
- Display total balances of all clients

## 💾 Data Storage

- Client data is stored in a **text file (`clients.txt`)**
- Each client record is saved in a structured format using a custom delimiter:
